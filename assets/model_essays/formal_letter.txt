Dear Sir,

PEST INVASION OF OUR CROPS

I write formally, on behalf of the farmers in Aponmu community, to inform you about the invasion of our cocoa farms by pests...
...We would be most grateful if you could use your good office and resources at your disposal to rescue us out of our present predicament.

Yours faithfully,
Adekunle Adewale.
